# Hi there, I'm JourneyShare! ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a beginner ethical hacker and Python coder, passionate about exploring the world of cybersecurity and programming.  

## About Me  

I love to tinker with objects and programs to understand how they work. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a few projects aimed at automating some hacking processes, along with fun coding projects to enhance my skills.  

### Learning Journey  

- **Courses:** I'm currently taking courses on Udemy focused on ethical hacking and Python coding.  
- **Tools & Technologies:** I primarily use Kali Linux, Python, and Visual Studio for my projects.  

## Future Goals  

I'm aiming to start a career in cybersecurity and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). Iâ€™m eager to collaborate with fellow coders and learn from the community.  

## Get in Touch  

While I don't have a personal website yet, I plan to create one soon. In the meantime, feel free to reach out here on GitHub!  

## Hobbies  

Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and exploring new places.
